SOURCE CODE LICENSING
________________________________________________________________________________

This document reviews the licenses governing the Version Information Spy source
code that is available from DelphiDabbler.com and the Subversion repository on
Google Code at http://code.google.com/p/verinfo-tools/source/browse/.

The source code includes:

+ Original Source Code written by Peter Johnson.
+ Auto-generated source code.
+ Various image files.

The download does not include all the source code required to build Version
Information Spy. Explicitly it doesn't include:

+ Source files from the Delphi VCL. You must have Delphi 2010 or later to access
  these files.
+ DelphiDabbler library components and units. These are all available from
  http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vis/download
+ DelphiDabbler Binary Version Information Manipulator Library. Source code for
  this library is available from
  http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vibindata/download or the Subversion
  repository at http://code.google.com/p/verinfo-tools/source/browse/

Original Source Code
________________________________________________________________________________

Original source files are stored in sub-directories of the "Src" directory.

Any original source code file that is governed by a license has a comment to
that effect in the source. The exception is that .dfm files are considered to be
governed by the same license as their associated .pas file.

Where files are auto-generated (such as .cfg files), and there are no copyright
or license comments in the files, the licensing of the file depends on how it
was generated. If the file was generated from another source file then the
generated file is covered by the same license as the originating source file, if
any. Otherwise the file is placed in the public domain.

Any other source code files that contain no copyright or license information are
public domain.

Many files are licensed under the Mozilla Public License. A full copy of that
license can be found in MPL.txt

Image Files (.ico, .bmp, .gif)
________________________________________________________________________________

The images used in the program are stored in the "Src" directory and its
sub-directories.

Images may also be embedded in forms by various VCL controls. Separate image
files are not provided in this case.

All images are either original or have been copied or adapted from various
sources. With the exception of the images listed under "Exceptions" below, all
images are in the public domain and can be re-used without restriction.

Exceptions
----------

The files Src\App\Images\FileVer.ico and Src\CmdApp\Images\FileVerCmd.ico are
both copyright (C) 2009 Peter Johnson (www.delphidabbler.com). These files may
not be altered in any way and may not be used in any other programs, including
programs derived from the Version Information Spy code base, unless explicit
permission is given by the author. This means that if you modify an aspect of
the Version Information Spy code base and publish your changes then you must
remove the icons or repace them with you own.
