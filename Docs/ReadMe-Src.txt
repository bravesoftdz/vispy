In order to compile the source you also need to create a "Exe" directory at the
same level as the "Bin" and "Src" directories.

Additional libraries / components are required to compile CodeSnip successfully.
They are:

  From DelphiDabbler.com:
    About Box Component (v3.1.1 or later) (*1)
    Version Information Component (v3.1.1 or later) (*1)
    Drop Files Components (v5.0.1 or later) (*1)
    Window State Components (v5.1 or later) (*1)
    Message Dialog Components (v2.2 or later) (*1)
    System Information Unit (v2.1 or later) (*1)
    Stream Extension Classes (v2.0.1 or later) (*2)
    Version Information Manipulator Library DLL (*3)
  The Delphi 7 VCL

  All the DelphiDabbler components, units and libraries are available from
  Version Information Spy's download page at
  http://www.delphidabbler.com/software?id=vis&tab=download
  
  Components marked (*1) must be installed on Delphi's component palette since
  they are required at design time.
  
  Components and units marked (*1) and (*2) need to be available on Delphi's
  library path.
  
  An executable copy of the DLL marked (*3) must be copied to Version
  Information Spy's "Exe" directory in order for the program to run. The source
  code for the library is also available. An interface unit to the DLL is
  provided with the Version Information Spy source code.
  
  The program also requires various binary resource files in order to compile.
  These files are provided in the sub directories of the "Bin" directory. The
  files are:
  
    Bin\App\Images.res - images used in the main Windows application.
    Bin\App\VFileVer.res - version information for the main Windows application.
    Bin\CmdApp\FVCImages.res - images used in the command line application.
    Bin\CmdApp\VFileVerCmd.res - version information for the command line
      application.
    Bin\CtxMenu\VFileVerCM.res - version information for the shell extension
      DLL.
    Bin\CtxMenu\VIPropSheetDlg.res - property sheet dialog box used by the
      shell extension DLL.
    Bin\Reader\VFVFileReader.res - version information for the version info file
      reader DLL.
    Bin\Reporter\HTML.res - RT_HTML resources containing HTML, images and CSS
      files displayed in documentation generated by the reporter DLL.
    Bin\Reporter\VFVReport.res - version information for the reporter DLL.

Build Tools
________________________________________________________________________________

Each application and DLL along with the installer has its own build.bat batch
file that can be used to automate full or partial builds. Each batch file must
be called using a command line parameter, as follows:

  Src\App\Build.bat:
    all - builds everything
    res - builds binary resource files (requires VIEd and BRCC32)
    pas - builds Pascal source and links with resource files (requires DCC32)
    help - builds help files (requires HCRTF)
 
  Src\CmdApp\Build.bat
    all - builds everything
    res - builds binary resource files (requires VIEd and BRCC32)
    pas - builds Pascal source and links with resource files (requires DCC32)
    
  Src\CtxMenu\Build.bat
    all - builds everything
    res - builds binary resource files (requires VIEd and BRCC32)
    pas - builds Pascal source and links with resource files (requires DCC32)
    help - builds help files (requires HCRTF)

  Src\Installer\Build.bat
    no switches required (requires ISCC)
  
  Src\Reader\Build.bat
    all - builds everything
    res - builds binary resource files (requires VIEd and BRCC32)
    pas - builds Pascal source and links with resource files (requires DCC32)
    
  Src\Reporter\Build.bat
    all - builds everything
    res - builds binary resource files (requires VIEd and BRCC32)
    pas - builds Pascal source and links with resource files (requires DCC32)

The programs required by the build process are:

+ VIEd    - DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor, available from
            www.delphidabbler.com. Requires v2.11 or later.
+ BRCC32  - Borland Resource Compiler, supplied with Delphi 7.
+ DCC32   - Delphi Command Line Compiler, supplied with Delphi 7.
+ HCRTF   - Microsoft Help Compiler, supplied with Delphi 7.
+ ISCC    - Inno Setup command line compiler, supplied with Inno Setup. Requires
            Inno Setup v5 with ISPP v5
        
The batch files require that the following environment variables are set:

+ INNOSETUP - set to the install directory of Inno Setup 5.
+ DELPHI7 - set to the install directory of Delphi 7: used to find BRCC32,
   DCC32 and HCRTF
+ DELPHIDABLIBD7 - set to the install directory of the required DelphiDabbler
    components on Delphi 7.

VIEd is expected to be on the path. If it is not add its install directory to
the PATH environment variable
