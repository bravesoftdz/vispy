      Descriptive Text Report Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box displays a descriptive, plain text, description of the
      current file's version information. The report is the same as the
      equivalent report displayed by the <a
        href="command-line-program.htm"
      >command line program</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>View Externally</em> button displays the report in the
      default text editor. If no text editor is registered then an error message
      is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save a copy of the report to disk click the <em>Save</em> button. The
      <em>Copy</em> button stores the report text on the clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Close</em> to dismiss the dialog box.
