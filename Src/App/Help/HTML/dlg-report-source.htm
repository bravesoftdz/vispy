    <h1>
      Resource Source Code Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog displays decompiled resource (RC) source code for the current
      file's version information. It is displayed when either the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Report | Source Code</span> or <span
        class="menuref"
      >Report | Corrected Source Code</span> menu options are selected. (The
      latter is only enabled if the program detects problems with the version
      information).
    </p>
    <p>
      The code that is displayed varies slightly depending on which menu option
      was used to display the dialog box. Here are the differences:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <span
          class="menuref"
        >Report | Source Code</span><br>
        The source code is a an estimation of the code that was used to create
        the resource. If any errors or inconsistencies have been detected the
        they are noted in comments in the source code but are not fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span
          class="menuref"
        >Report | Corrected Source Code</span><br>
        The errors detected in the source code are corrected and comments are
        used to identify the changes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>View Externally</em> button displays the source code in
      <em>NotePad</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save the source code to disk click the <em>Save</em> button. The
      <em>Copy</em> button stores the code on the clipboard in text format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Close</em> to dismiss the dialog box.
    </p>
