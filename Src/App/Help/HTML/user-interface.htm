      User Interface
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em>'s main window is separated into three
      main areas:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The menu bar.</strong><br>
        Use the <a
          href="commands.htm"
        >menu commands</a> to control the program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The toolbar.</strong><br>
        Buttons that replicate some of the menu commands are displayed on the <a
          href="toolbar.htm"
        >toolbar</a>. The toolbar is optional and may be hidden. The
        <span
          class="menuref"
        >Options | Toolbar</span> menu option is used to display and hide the
        toolbar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The display area.</strong><br>
        This is where details of the current file's version information is
        displayed. See <a
          href="display.htm"
        >Displaying Version Information</a> for further details. The display
        area can be customised using the <span
          class="menuref"
        >Options | Display  Options</span> menu command to access the <a
          href="dlg-display-options.htm"
        >Display Options dialog box</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The program's window can be resized in the usual fashion &ndash; and its
      size and placement are remembered between executions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em> can optionally be activated from Windows
      Explorer by selecting &quot;Version Information&quot; from the menu that
      appears when an executable file is right clicked. The program also adds a
      new page to Explorer's property dialog box for files that contain version
      information. See the <a
        href="explorer-extensions.htm"
      >Using the Explorer Extensions</a> topic for more information.
