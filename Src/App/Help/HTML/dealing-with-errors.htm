    <h1>
      Dealing With Errors and Inconsistencies
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em> can handle version information data that
      breaks the resource's data format rules. It can even display some code
      that the Windows API will fail on. It silently reads and displays the data
      in these cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program can also cope with version information that breaks the
      semantic rules set down by Microsoft. It detects some of these and draws
      them to the user's attention. In particular the program flags up the
      following conditions:
    </p>
    <ol class="spaced">
      <li>
        Where there is translation information present but there are no string
        tables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where there are string tables but no translation data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where there are both string tables and translation data but the string
        table's locale information does not match the translation data.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These cases are highlighted in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ol class="spaced">
      <li>
        Highlighting a problem translation in the translation drop down list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Placing a brief description of the error above the drop down list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Displaying a button above the drop down list that, when clicked,
        displays a report of the problem in the <a
          href="dlg-bad-trans.htm"
        >Translation Inconsistency Explanation dialog box</a>. This report also
        suggests how to fix the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Noting problems in the text and HTML <a
          href="creating-reports.htm"
        >reports</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The first three methods noted above can be configured and disabled or
      enabled by the user in the <a
        href="dlg-display-options.htm"
      >Display Options dialog box</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the program can generate RC source code for the version
      information that either fixes the problems or notes the problems in
      comments in the code.
