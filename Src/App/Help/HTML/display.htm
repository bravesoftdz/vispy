      Displaying Version Information
    </h1>
    <p>
      When a file containing version information is loaded the information is
      displayed in the main window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version information falls into two distinct types: Fixed File Information
      and Variable Information.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fixed file information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fixed File Information describes the various attributes of the file
      concerned. This information is displayed at the top of the main window.
      <br>
      &raquo; <a
        href="fixed-file-info.htm"
      >More info</a>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Variable information
    </h2>
    <p>
      The variable information section largely consists of descriptive strings
      (String File Information). This information is displayed towards the
      bottom of the main window. There can be more than one table of string
      information in a version information resource. These are usually in
      different languages and / or use different character sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The different combinations of languages and character sets are listed in
      the <em>Translations</em> drop down list. Selecting a
      &quot;translation&quot; from this list displays the table of String File
      Information that is associated with it. When the file is first loaded the
      string table associated with the first translation in the file is
      displayed. Most files contain only one "translation".<br>
      &raquo; <a
        href="string-info.htm"
      >More info</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      String information can be sorted by name by clicking the string name
      column header or by right clicking and selecting the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Sort By Name</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version information specification requires that the translations and
      string information language and character codes should match &ndash; but
      some programs do not follow this rule. Problems can be either that there
      is no translation associated with a particular string table or that there
      is no string table associated with a given translation. <em>Version
      Information Spy</em> detects these problems and can highlight them,
      provide additional information and suggest fixes. These features are
      configured on the <em>Translation</em> tab of the <a
        href="dlg-display-options.htm"
      >Display Options dialog box</a>.
