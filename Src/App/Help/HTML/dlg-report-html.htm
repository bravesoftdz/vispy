      Descriptive HTML Report Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box displays a descriptive report of the current file's
      version information in HTML format. Any inconsistencies in the file are
      noted. Further explanation of some of the items in the report is
      available, indicated by help icons. Clicking the icons causes relevant
      topics in the help file to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save a copy of the report in HTML format to disk click the
      <em>Save</em> button. The <em>Copy</em> button stores the HTML on the
      clipboard in text format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>View in IE</em> button displays the HTML report in
      <em>Internet Explorer</em>. If the program can't find the browser the
      button is disabled. <em>Internet Explorer</em> is used even if it is not
      the system's default browser because the HTML code uses the res://
      protocol and this is not supported by other manaufacturer's browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <em>Close</em> to dismiss the dialog box.
