    <h1>
      Translation Inconsistency Explanation Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      Providing the facility is enabled (see below), <em>Version Information
      Spy</em> shows this dialog box when the user has clicked the <em>Explain
      Problem</em> button on the main user interface. The button appears when an
      inconsistency in a translation or string table has been detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog box displays report on the problem that caused the translation
      inconsistency. An explanation of the problem is offered along with some
      resource (RC) source code that shows the changes to the version
      information necessary to fix the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Close</em> button to dismiss the dialog box.
    </p>

    <p>
      If no <em>Explain Problem</em> button is displayed when a translation
      inconsistency is reported you can switch the feature on as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        Select the <span
          class="menuref"
        >Options | Display Options</span> menu item to show the <a
          href="dlg-display-options.htm"
        >Display Options dialog box</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose the <em>Translations</em> tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tick the <em>Add explanation button</em> check box.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click <em>OK</em> to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
