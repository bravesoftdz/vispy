    <h1>
      Opening a File
    </h1>
    <p>
      There are several ways in which files can be loaded into the program. They
      are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the <span
          class="menuref"
        >File | Open</span> menu item. This displays a standard Windows dialog
        box where a file can be selected. By default the dialog box only
        displays EXE and DLL files. Other file types can be displayed by
        selecting the <em>All Files</em> filter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the <img
          src="../images/btn-open.gif"
          class="glyph"
        > button on the toolbar. This displays the same dialog box as described
        in 1 above. (Note: if the toolbar is not visible it can be displayed
        using the <span
          class="menuref"
        >Options | Toolbar</span> menu option).
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a file in Windows Explorer, drag it over the <em>Version
        Information Spy</em> window and then drop it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Explorer extensions to either display a selected file's version
        information in the program or on a custom property sheet. See <a
          href="explorer-extensions.htm"
        >Using the Explorer Extensions</a> topic for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pass a file name to the program on the command line.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once a file has been loaded the program attempts to extract version
      information from it. If successful the information is displayed in the
      main window. Should the selected file contain no version information then
      a message is displayed to that effect.
