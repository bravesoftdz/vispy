      Main Features
    </h1>
    <p>
      The key features of <em>Version Information Spy</em> are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Version information can be read from 16 and 32 bit executables (.exe,
        .dll, .ocx etc) and from 32 bit binary resource files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Version information that contains information in more than one language
        is supported.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reports describing a file's version information can be produced in
        text, XML and HTML format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Binary version information can be de-compiled into the equivalent RC
        source code and any errors and inconsistencies in the original code can
        optionally be fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Version information that departs from the Microsoft standard (and some
        that defeat the Windows API calls) are handled. Any inconsistencies in
        version information can be flagged up. Reports of errors and suggestions
        for fixes can be displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a command line application that can produce text reports or
        decompiled source code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Version Information Spy</em> integrates with the Windows shell to
        provide two highly customisable shell extensions:
        <ol>
          <li>
            A context menu handler that launches <em>Version Information
            Spy</em> to display version info for a selected executable or
            resource file.
          </li>
          <li>
            A property sheet extension that provides extended version
            information in a selected file's property sheet.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        The configurable user interface supports XP themes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
