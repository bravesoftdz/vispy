    <h1>
      Display Options Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This tabbed dialog box is used to customise <em>Version Information
      Spy</em>'s appearance. It is accessed from the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Options | Display Options</span> menu item. The four tabs are:
    </p>
    <h2>
      Pop-ups
    </h2>
    <p>
      Used to determine whether a pop-up hint is displayed when the cursor
      hovers over information that extends beyond the edge of the display. If
      the <em>Display overflow text in pop-up window</em> check box is checked
      these pop-up windows are displayed (the default). Clear the check box to
      prevent pop-ups.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Fixed File Info
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab is used to configure how <a
        href="fixed-file-info.htm"
      >fixed file information</a> is displayed. There are three options, each
      selected via a check box:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <em>Display structure information</em><br>
        Two lines of information that describe the fixed file information record
        structure can be displayed &nbsp; the structure's version number and a
        &quot;signature&quot;. This information is the same for every program,
        so the information is of little value and is hidden by default. Tick the
        check box to display the information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Display creation date</em><br>
        Programmers may store a program's creation date in a fixed file
        information field, although this is rarely done. <em>Version Information
        Spy</em> can display this field, which is hidden by default. Tick the
        check box to display the creation date.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Describe file flags</em><br>
        The <em>File Flags</em> and <em>File Flags Mask</em> fixed file
        information fields are bitmasks that can either be displayed as hex
        values or as natural language descriptions of the flags. Check the box
        to display the natural language description and clear it to display the
        value in hexadecimal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Translation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several programs contain version information that departs from the
      Microsoft specification which states that for each translation there
      should be a matching string table. <em>Version Information Spy</em> can
      detect any deviation from the standard and can highlight or provide
      additional information about such inconsistencies. Use the following
      controls to customise how these errors are reported:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <em>Highlight inconsistent translation entries</em><br>
        When this check box is ticked inconsistent translations are highlighted
        in the translation drop-down list using the colour specified by the
        <em>Highlight colour colour</em> selector.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Explain translation inconsistencies</em><br>
        A brief explanation of any translation inconsistencies is displayed
        above the translation drop-down list if this check box is ticked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Add explanation button</em><br>
        If this box is checked a button is displayed above the translation
        drop-down list whenever an inconsistent translation is selected.
        Clicking the button displays detailed information about the problem
        along with a suggestion as to how to fix it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      String Info
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab is used to configure how the <a
        href="string-info.htm"
      >string file information</a> is displayed. While most software names the
      strings in this section according to the standard recommended by Microsoft
      it is possible (and quite common) to include arbitrary string names in
      string tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em> can highlight such names in the colour
      specified in the <em>Highlight colour</em> colour selector. You must check
      the <em>Highlight non-standard string information items</em> check box to
      enable this feature.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Other Controls
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can restore all the display options to their default values by
      clicking the <em>Restore Defaults</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      All changes can be aborted by clicking the <em>Cancel button</em>. Click
      <em>OK</em> to accept changes. Changes are immediately reflected in the
      display.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog box remembers the tab that was in use when the dialog is closed
      and displays the same tab again when the dialog is next opened.
