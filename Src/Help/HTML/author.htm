      About the Author
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm Peter Johnson (aka DelphiDabbler) &ndash; a hobbyist programmer living
      in Ceredigion in West Wales, UK. I write mainly in Delphi, but
      occasionally dabble in other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      My open source programs and Delphi components are available from my web
      site <a
        href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/"

      >DelphiDabbler.com</a>. Updates are usually uploaded there first.
