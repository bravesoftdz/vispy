      Popup Menu Commands

    <p>
      There is only one context pop-up menu in the program and that appears when
      the <em>String File Information</em> list is right clicked. This menu has
      a single item:
    </p>
    <table class="menu">
      <tr>
        <td class="item">
          Sort by Name (<span
            class="smallcaps"
          >Ctrl+N</span>)
        </td>
        <td class="desc">
          This sorts the string file information on the string names. This can
          also be achieved by clicking the column header.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
