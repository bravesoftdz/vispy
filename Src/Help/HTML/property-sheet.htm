      The Version Extra Property Sheet
    </h1>
    <p>
      This property sheet is one of the <a
        href="explorer-extensions.htm"
      >extensions</a> added to Explorer by <em>Version Information Spy</em>. The
      property sheet is added to the standard Explorer <em>Properties</em>
      dialog box that can be displayed from Explorer's pop-up menu. The property
      sheet is only displayed for executable files of types registered with
      <em>Version Information Spy</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The property sheet provides more detailed version information than is
      supplied in the Properties dialog box by default. The information
      displayed has a similar layout to the <em>Version Information
      Spy</em> program's <a
        href="display.htm"
      >main display</a>, but does not support all the highlighting and reporting
      features of the main program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information displayed is:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <a
          href="fixed-file-info.htm"
        >Fixed file information</a> at the top of the property sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Details of all the translations (languages and character sets) used by
        the program. This information appears in the drop down list in the
        middle of the property sheet. There is usually only one translation,
        but there may be more.
      </li>
      <li>
        A table of
        <a
          href="string-info.htm"
        >String information</a> at the bottom of the property sheet. There
        should be one string table for each translation. Selecting a translation
        will display any associated string table.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the full facilities of the main program are required then clicking the
      <em>Advanced</em> button starts the main program and displays the file's
      version information in it.
    </p>
