      Add Extension Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box is displayed when the <em>Add</em> button of the <a
        href="dlg-explorer-ext.htm"
      >Explorer Extensions dialog box</a> is clicked. It is used to select or
      enter an extension that will be added to the list of extensions supported
      by the program's Explorer extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either select an extension from the list of extensions known to Windows or
      enter one in the edit box then press <em>OK</em> to add the extension or
      <em>Cancel</em> to abort the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that extensions already known to the explorer extensions are
      displayed in grey and the <em>OK</em> button is disabled if one of these
      extensions is selected.
