      Creating Reports
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em> doesn't just display the version
      information from within a program, it also lets you get some reports on
      the content. There are four main reports that are available:
    </p>
    <ol class="spaced">
      <li>
        A plain text description of the version information contained in the
        current file. This is provided in a human readable format suitable for
        documenting a program. Any structural problems are flagged up but not
        explained. This report appears in the <a
          href="dlg-report-text.htm"
        >Descriptive Text Report dialog box</a> and is accessed via the <span
          class="menuref"
        >Reports | Text Description</span> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        A HTML description of a file's version information. This report provides
        essentially the same information as the plain text report but it is laid
        out in a much more attractive and readbale format. The report goes into
        more detail about any translation / string table inconsistencies. This
        report is displayed in the <a
          href="dlg-report-html.htm"
        >Descriptive HTML Report dialog box</a> and is displayed by clicking the
        <span
          class="menuref"
        >Reports | HTML Description</span> menu item.
      </li>
      <li>
        A XML document containing all of a file's version information. This
        report is displayed in the <a
          href="dlg-report-xml.htm"
        >XML Report dialog box</a> which is activated from the <span
          class="menuref"
        >Reports | XML menu</span> item.
      </li>
      <li>
        For files that have structural inconsistencies a separate report of each
        translation or string table's problems is available. This report is in
        HTML format. It describes the problem in detail and suggests source
        code changes to fix the problem. This facility can be enabled and
        disabled via the <a
          href="dlg-display-options.htm"
        >Display Options dialog box</a> (<em>Translations</em> tab). When enabled
        a <em>Explain Problem</em> button appears above the main window's
        translations drop-down list whenever the current translation exhibits
        inconsistencies. Clicking the button displays the report in the <a
          href="dlg-bad-trans.htm"
        >Translation Inconsistency Explanation dialog box</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
