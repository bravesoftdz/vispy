    <h1>
      Explorer Extension Configuration Dialog Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialog box permits the Explorer shell extensions to be enabled,
      disabled and configured. The dialog is displayed by selecting the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Options | Explorer Extensions</span> menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog box has two tabs &ndash; basic and advanced. The basic tab can
      be used for straightforward configuration of the extensions, while the
      advanced tab is used for more refined &quot;tweaking&quot;.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Basic tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab contains four check boxes that are used to set up the shell
      extensions and the behaviour of <em>Version Information Spy</em> when
      working with the extensions. A description of each check box follows.
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        <em>Enable Explorer context menu extension</em><br>
        Use this check box to enable or disable the context menu handler.
        Enabling the handler registers it for use with all the file extensions
        listed on the <em>Advanced tab</em>. This handler adds a <span
          class="menuref"
        >Version Information</span> menu item to Explorer's context menu which
        opens the selected file in <em>Version Information Spy</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Enable Explorer property sheet tab</em><br>
        This check box enables or disables the property sheet tab extension.
        Enabling the property sheet tab registers it for use with all the file
        extensions listed on the <em>Advanced tab</em>. This extension adds a
        <em>Version Extra</em> tab to a file's property sheet and displays
        version information in it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Explorer extensions use a single application instance</em><br>
        The context menu handler extension activates <em>Version Information
        Spy</em> to display version information for a selected file while the
        property sheet extension can activate <em>Version Information Spy</em>
        when the <em>Advanced</em> button is clicked. You can configure these
        extensions to re-use an open instance of <em>Version Information
        Spy</em> (checked) or to always start a new instance (unchecked).
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Ask user whether to register extension for new file extensions</em>
        <br>
        When <em>Version Information Spy</em> opens a file which has an
        extension that is not known the to explorer extensions it can offer to
        register the extension with them. Check this box to use this facility.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>Enable Explorer context menu extension</em> and <em>Enable
      Explorer property sheet tab</em> check boxes can have an indeterminate
      state. In this case consult the <em>Advanced tab</em> to see which file
      extensions are registered.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Advanced tab
    </h2>
    <p>
      This tab lists the types of file containing version information that are
      known to the program. Some file types are pre-defined while others may
      have been added to the list by the user. There are two check boxes next to
      each file extension. Check the first check box (column <em>CM</em>) to
      register the file extension with the contect menu handler. Check the second
      box (column <em>PS</em>) to register it with the property sheet extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the <em>Select All</em> button to check all the boxes or use
      <em>Clear All</em> to clear them all. This is the same as checking or
      clearing both the <em>Enable Explorer context menu extension</em> and
      <em>Enable Explorer property sheet tab</em> check boxes on the
      <em>Basic</em> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      New file extensions can be added to the list manually by clicking the
      <em>Add</em> button and selecting the required file extension from the <a
        href="dlg-add-extension.htm"
      >Add Extension dialog box</a>. The newly added file extension appears in
      the list. You need to tick the related check boxes to register the
      extension with the context menu or property sheet extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      File extensions can be deleted from the list by highlighting the extension
      and clicking the <em>Delete</em> button. Note that the .dll, .exe and .res
      extensions are required and cannot be deleted, although they can be hidden
      from the shell extensions by clearing the appropriate check boxes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Other controls
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once selections have been made choose the <em>OK</em> button to confirm
      selections or the <em>Cancel</em> button to abort the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialog box remembers the tab that was in use when it is closed and
      displays the same tab again when the dialog is next opened.
