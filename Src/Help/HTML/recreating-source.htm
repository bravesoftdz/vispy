    <h1>
      Recreating RC Source Code
    </h1>
    <p>
      <em>Version Information Spy</em> can recreate, or at least estimate, the
      resource source code that was used to create a version information
      resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this open a file in the program to display its version information.
      Now select the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Report | Source Code</span> menu option. This will display the decompiled
      source in the <a
        href="dlg-report-source.htm"
      >Resource Source Code dialog box</a>. You can copy this source to the
      clipboard or save it to disk. A resource compiler such as Borland's
      <code>BRCC32</code> will be able to compile this code into a binary
      resource file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the version information has inconsistencies the program can also create
      source code that fixes the problems. Use the <span
        class="menuref"
      >Report | Corrected Source Code</span> menu option to do this. The result
      is displayed in the <a
        href="dlg-report-source.htm"
      >Resource Source Code dialog box</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command line version of <em>Version Information Spy</em> can also be
      used to recreate a RC source file from a program's version information.
      See the <a
        href="command-line-program.htm"
      >command line program</a> topic for an example of how to do this.
